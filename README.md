# Project_3
Project Proposal
1. Project Title: Sign Language Recognition with Machine Learning
2. Team Members: Anjali Krishna Vengayil, Anh Huynh, Chander Viswanathan, Jeanette Ilongo
3. Project Description/Outline: We would like to build a machine that can read and interpret the sign language alphabet by looking at a personâ€™s hand. 
4. Research Questions to Answer: How can we predict the static sign language gesture and how can we isolate the hand gesture and feed this image in the static gesture recognizer?
5. Data sources or Data Sets to be Used: https://medium.freecodecamp.org (example), Sci-Kit Learn, OpenCV, HTML/CSS/Bootstrap, Python Flask, Tabl
6. APIs to be consumed (if any) - None
7. Rough Breakdown of Tasks:
   Scrum Masters: Anh
   Data Engineers: Anjali
   Team Lead: Jeanette
   Testers: Chander
